ECLIPSE ANDROID PROJECT IMPORT SUMMARY
======================================

Ignored Files:
--------------
The following files were *not* copied into the new Gradle project; you
should evaluate whether these are still needed in your project and if
so manually move them:

* build.gradle
* proguard-project.txt

Moved Files:
------------
Android Gradle projects use a different directory structure than ADT
Eclipse projects. Here's how the projects were restructured:

In SMSSDK:
* AndroidManifest.xml => sMSSDK\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => sMSSDK\src\main\assets
* libs\MobCommons-2016.1201.1839.jar => sMSSDK\libs\MobCommons-2016.1201.1839.jar
* libs\MobTools-2016.1201.1839.jar => sMSSDK\libs\MobTools-2016.1201.1839.jar
* libs\SMSSDK-2.1.3.jar => sMSSDK\libs\SMSSDK-2.1.3.jar
* res\ => sMSSDK\src\main\res\
* src\ => sMSSDK\src\main\java
In ShortMessageSDKGUI:
* AndroidManifest.xml => shortMessageSDKGUI\src\main\AndroidManifest.xml
* assets\ => shortMessageSDKGUI\src\main\assets
* proguard-project.txt => shortMessageSDKGUI\proguard-project.txt
* res\ => shortMessageSDKGUI\src\main\res\
* src\ => shortMessageSDKGUI\src\main\java\

Next Steps:
-----------
You can now build the project. The Gradle project needs network
connectivity to download dependencies.

Bugs:
-----
If for some reason your project does not build, and you determine that
it is due to a bug or limitation of the Eclipse to Gradle importer,
please file a bug at http://b.android.com with category
Component-Tools.

after import once you are satisfied with the results.)
